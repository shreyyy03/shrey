Steps
The Counter class from the collections module is used to count the occurrences of characters in the input string inputString.
The is_valid_word function is defined to check whether a given word from the dictionary can be formed using the characters in the input string.
It iterates over each character in the word and verifies if the count of that character in the word is less than or equal to the count of the same character in the input string. This check ensures that each letter in the word can be formed from the available characters in the input string.
The line => [word for word in dictionary if is_valid_word(word, input_count)] is used to filter out the words from the dictionary that can be formed using the characters in the input string
